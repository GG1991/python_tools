These are a group of python functions and examples designed by 
Miguel Zavala Ã€ke from Barcelona Supercomputing Center 
and are very helpful to extract data from different file format 
such as :

* vtk
* pvtu

for using the modules it is necesary to include this folder on 
the PYTHONPATH:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/home/guido/codes/python_tools"
```
